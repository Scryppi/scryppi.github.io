				<p class="profession-description">
					Javascript developer.
					<br/><br/>
					5+ years of experience, started working as an HTML, CSS, JS coder, after some time he wrote php, after the first year and a half in development he switched to React.js, I also had little experience with Node.js, Express.js ( about a year in total), have excellent experience and solid knowledge with different ecosystems of react - Redux, Redux-thunk, Redux-saga, Redux-observable, mobX, useQuery. I also own Next.js - React.js framework to support Sever side rendering(SSR) out of the box. I am also fluent in various UI libraries - Material UI, Ant Design, Bootstrap, etc. I also worked and took part in choosing the application architecture - Domain driven design (which we abandoned after a couple of months of working on it due to incomprehensibility and overengineering), hexagonal architecture and feature-sliced.
					<br/><br/>
					Worked in different companies where the development team consisted of 10 people and without QA stands, and in a team with 50+ developers with several development teams, QA, daily-meetup, agile, planing and retrospectives. So it is in a startup with an oral distribution of tasks.
