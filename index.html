				<p class="profession-description">
					Javascript developer.
					<br/><br/>
					7+ years of experience, started working with HTML, CSS, JS, then wrote PHP for some time. After the first year and a half in development, I switched to React.js, huge experience and confident knowledge of different react ecosystems - React-query, Redux, Redux-thunk, Redux-saga, Redux-observable, mobX, react-query, rxJS as well as Node.js, Exress.js. I also own Next.js - React.js framework for supporting Sever side rendering (SSR). I am also fluent in various UI libraries - Material UI, Ant Design, Bootstrap, etc. and created my own storybook UI libraries. During this time, I worked and took part in the selection of application architecture (worked with Domain driven design, clean architecture and feature sliced ​​design). I can analyze and notice places where you can speed up web applications, reduce the load on the server, web vitals, sentry, e2e and unit testing.
					<br/><br/>
					Worked in different companies where the development team consisted of 10 people and without QA stands, and in a team with 50+ developers with several development teams, QA, daily meetings, agile, plannings and retrospectives. And in a startup with oral distribution of tasks.
